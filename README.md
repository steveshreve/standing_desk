Notes from my low cost standing desk project

Steve’s $200 Standing Desk
Inspiration and initial specs:
http://www.flintdigital.com/flint-digitals-stand-up-desks/ 

1) GALVANIZED PIPE
Steve’s Desk – Pipe sourced at local home depot (~$68)
I tried to source a plumbing supply, but had no luck. Opted for local home depot. Buy the 10’ lengths of pipe in plumbing department and they cut it for free on the Rigid pipe cutter.
Pipe source / cost
Pipe 1:   1 ¼”  x 10ft (120”):  $28
Pipe 2:   1” x 10ft (120”):  $20 
Pipe 3:   1” x 10ft (120”):  $20 
PIPE CUT LIST
For the 8 leg pieces, I had HD cut off the threaded ends and cut the remaining length into 4 equal parts.
120” – 2” / 4 = 29.5”.  As long as the cuts are equal, 25-29” is good. 

•	Pipe 1 (upper / outer legs):   
Dia: 1 1/4″,  Length 29.5 inch,  Quantity: 4

•	Pipe 2 (inner/lower legs):   
Dia: 1″,  Length: 29.5 | Quantity: 4

•	Pipe 3 (leg braces and cross bar):   
Dia: 1″,  Length: 21 inch | Quantity: 2
Dia: 1″,  Length: 51 inch | Quantity: 1


2) PIPE FITTING LIST
Steve’s Desk – Kee Klamp fittings sourced at farmtek.com (~$60 + shipping)
I shopped around for the lowest kee klamp prices.  If you find a cheaper source than farmtek, let me know.
10016407 – Quik Klamp Base Flange 1 1/4" (for 1.66" OD Pipe), QTY 4
10015106 – Quik Klamp 1" Short Tee (for 1.315" OD Pipe), QTY 6


3) DESKTOP
IKEA Linnmon top.  $35.99
I purchased from the Sunrise, FL location. Can also be shipped for an extra 10 bucks.

4) MISC PARTS
•	16 wood screws to attach the flanges to the desk bottom. 3 bucks at Home Depot.
•	Allen wrenches for the flange and tee allen bolts. (My bicycle multi-tool had both sizes)
•	Plastic furniture sliders to protect the floor. 5 bucks at Home Depot
You could also get these plastic pipe plugs:

•	Black spray paint.  Unless you source black plumbing pipe, you will have to paint the gray metal pipes black yourself. 
Next time, I’d order the black “gator tube” (more $$) or source black pipe (more time) rather than paint the pipe.  


5) EXTRAS
Floor Mat:
You WILL NEED an anti-fatigue floor mat to stand on.  I started with this 2x3’ one for $25 from Amazon:

Monitor Riser:
You will most likely need a riser of some type to get your monitor to eye level.
Going to try this one: http://lifehacker.com/5872323/diy-ikea-monitor-stand-for-12 
Drafting Stool:
Standing for 8-10 hours straight isn’t good for you either.  A height-adjustable drafting chair or stool will come in handy.
A stool is on my “to-buy” list
